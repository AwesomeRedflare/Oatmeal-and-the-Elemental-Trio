# Oatmeal and the Elemental Trio
 
Made for the Brackey's Game Jam 2021.1 which had the theme of "Stronger Together" and lasted a week.

You play as oatmeal starting out by yourself. There are three levels and one boss, and you can do them in any order. Everytime you beat a level you save one of your friends and they get added to your party. 

The gameplay is simple to the streetpass game MiiForce where you shoot to attack and you press buttons to rotate your orientation.
